This is Team SuyaScript (Software Developer) Learning Repository. 
Our Journey may start together but does not mean it will end together.

Please the first steps is to fork this Repository

Once Done go ahead and create a folder under this repository with your NAME

Then go ahead and start your coding process in your name folder.

I will be expecting to merge every result at the end of every weekend. 

The Whole Learning process will span for 6 months starting from September 15th, 2023

Stage 1 Assignment (5 weeks 15 Sept - 22 Oct)

Click on the link and ensure you create your own examples in your name folder and learn as well. 
Click on Audit content only for Coursera courses. If you know how to apply for financial aid you can as well do that. I will be guiding you how to do that at the end of the course. 

At the end of Week 1, each candidate would have learn about HTML, tags, CSS, Script, Frontend coding and Backend coding. 

Your name folder will be checked each week. So please keep at it.
